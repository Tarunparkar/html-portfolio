<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a passionate and self-driven student currently pursuing a degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at VESIT. With a strong foundation in both software development and data analytics, I enjoy building impactful projects that solve real-world problems—such as my recent work on an AQI monitoring system using Flutter and Firebase. I have also explored areas like ethical hacking, image processing, and web development. I’m always eager to learn new technologies, take on challenges, and contribute meaningfully to any team or project I’m part of.</p>
